# Disease-classsification

## Introduction
COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus. In COVID-19 patients, chest X-rays show signature patterns like patchy infiltrates, ground glass opacities and pulmonary consolidations indicating fluid buildup and inflammation. Identifying these early is key to isolation and care with oxygen support. Pneumonia is a common lung infection that inflames the alveoli in one or both lungs, filling them with fluid which appears as dense areas called consolidations on X-ray images. This makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake leading to issues if not treated promptly with antibiotics and medications. Chest X-rays are commonly used to diagnose various lung conditions. Identifying conditions accurately through X-rays can guide critical treatment decisions and care for patients suffering from respiratory illnesses. Normal chest X-rays show clear, black lung fields with no areas of abnormal opacity, consolidation or other artifacts. Minor variations can appear based on factors like patient positioning but a trained radiologist can discern normal lungs from ones with pneumonic or COVID-19 infections.
